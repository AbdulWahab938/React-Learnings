# React Hooks Learning Collection 🪝

A comprehensive collection of projects demonstrating React hooks with practical examples, performance optimizations, and real-world applications.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

Master React hooks from basic to advanced concepts:
- ✅ **Performance Optimization** - useMemo, useCallback, React.memo
- 🔄 **State Management** - useState, useReducer, useContext
- 🔄 **Side Effects** - useEffect, useLayoutEffect
- 🔄 **Custom Hooks** - Building reusable logic
- 🔄 **Advanced Patterns** - Hook composition, optimization strategies

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each hook has its own dedicated project with:
1. **Comprehensive README** - Theory and examples
2. **Interactive Demos** - Hands-on learning
3. **Performance Comparisons** - Before/after examples
4. **Best Practices** - What to do and what to avoid
5. **Real-world Applications** - Practical use cases

### Quick Start for Any Hook Project:
```bash
cd [hook-name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 📖 Recommended Learning Path

1. **Start with useMemo** 📍 - Foundation of React optimization
2. **Continue with useCallback** - Function memoization
3. **Master useEffect** - Side effects and lifecycle
4. **Learn useReducer** - Complex state patterns
5. **Build Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic patterns

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing all hook projects, you will:
- ✅ **Optimize React performance** with proper memoization
- ✅ **Manage complex state** with appropriate hooks
- ✅ **Handle side effects** efficiently and safely
- ✅ **Build reusable logic** with custom hooks
- ✅ **Debug performance issues** in React applications
- ✅ **Apply best practices** in professional development
